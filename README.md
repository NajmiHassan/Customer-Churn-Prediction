Download the csv file.
Download the python code file and run the code on jupiter notebook.
You can use pycharm but I used jupiter as it does not need to install packages.


Decision trees are a type of algorithm that uses a tree-like model to make decisions based on the features of the data. The tutorial aims to demonstrate how to run and evaluate these models using Python. Covering data pre-processing, which involves tasks like cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis. Model training and evaluation are important steps in the machine learning process, providing instructions on how to perform these tasks using Python. The focus is on predicting customer churn in a business scenario. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a product or service. Explaining how to use the machine learning models to predict customer churn and provides insights on how to interpret the results.

The steps involved in the machine learning process, as outlined in the given text, are as follows:

Loading data from CSV files: The first step in the machine learning process involves gathering the necessary data for analysis. This data can be sourced from CSV files. Loading the data is essential to ensure that the machine learning algorithms have the required input to make predictions or classifications.

Data pre-processing: Once the data is loaded, it often requires some pre-processing to make it suitable for analysis. This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming variables if necessary. Data pre-processing is crucial to ensure the quality and integrity of the dataset before training the machine learning models.

Model training: After the data is pre-processed, the next step is to train the machine learning models. This involves selecting an appropriate algorithm, such as decision trees and fitting the model to the training dataset. During the training process, the model learns to recognize patterns and relationships in the data.

Evaluation: Once the model is trained, it needs to be evaluated to assess its performance. Evaluation metrics like accuracy can be used to measure how well the model performs on the test dataset. This step is crucial in determining the effectiveness of the machine learning model and identifying any potential issues or areas for improvement.
